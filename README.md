#Next.js Todo App with Chakra UI

This is a Task Management App built with Next.js (App Router) and Chakra UI. The project demonstrates modern React practices, persistent storage, and an accessible UI framework to create a smooth task management experience.

 #Features:

Create Task â€“ Add new tasks with details like name, description, assignee, priority, and status.

Complete Task â€“ Mark tasks as complete, updating their status and including them in the complete section.

Task tabs view and status â€“ Navigate tasks by changing views from Table to card version ( To do, In Progress, Completed).

Persistent Storage â€“ Uses localStorage so tasks remain saved even after refreshing the page.

Responsive UI â€“ Powered by Chakra UIâ€™s styled components for consistency and accessibility.

Dynamic State Management  â€“ Real-time updates across components with React ContextAPI


#Tech Stack

Next.js 15+ (App Router) â€“ React framework with SSR/SSG support.

Chakra UI v2 â€“ Component library for styling and accessibility.

TypeScript â€“ Strong typing for safer and maintainable code.

LocalStorage â€“ Persist tasks on the client side.

#Development Notes

The app uses ChakraProvider at the root (layout.tsx).

localStorage is integrated with hydration-safe logic (useEffect) to avoid SSR/CSR mismatches.
